### Main Post:

**What if you could ask OmniFocus questions in plain English?**

I'm excited to share the beta release of **FocusRelayMCP** - a free, open-source bridge that lets AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT) query your OmniFocus data using natural language.

**The Problem We All Face:**

Ever found yourself:
- 📱 Scrolling through hundreds of tasks trying to find what to do next?
- 🤔 Wondering "What did I actually accomplish this week?" but too lazy to manually check?
- 🌍 Traveling and unsure what's available to work on in your current timezone?
- 🚫 Staring at projects that seem stuck but can't figure out why?

**What FocusRelayMCP Solves:**

✅ **"What should I do today?"** - Gets tasks due today, filtered by your local timezone
✅ **"What about this morning?"** - Filters by time periods (6am-12pm, 12pm-6pm, 6pm-10pm)
✅ **"What projects have no next actions?"** - Identifies stalled projects instantly
✅ **"What contexts do I have available?"** - Shows tags with actionable tasks
✅ **"What have I been avoiding?"** - Finds tasks deferred for 30/90/365 days
✅ **"What did I accomplish this week?"** - Completed task summaries

**How It Works:**

1. Install the plugin (takes 2 minutes)
2. Connect to your AI assistant via MCP
3. Ask questions in plain English
4. Get instant, intelligent answers

**Technical Innovation:**

Unlike traditional Omni Automation approaches that can be slow, we built a **novel Bridge Library architecture** that:

- Runs directly inside OmniFocus's JavaScript context (not external scripting)
- Uses **single-pass filtering** - all query conditions evaluated in one iteration
- **Early exit optimization** - stops processing once it finds your requested number of results
- File-based IPC for fast communication between the MCP server and OmniFocus
- **Timezone-aware calculations** done locally before filtering

**Result:** Sub-second query responses even with thousands of tasks. No more waiting for OmniFocus to slowly return results.

**Technical Details:**

- Runs locally on your Mac (privacy-first, no cloud)
- Integrates via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Works with Claude Desktop, opencode, and other MCP clients
- Timezone-aware (handles travel seamlessly)
- Read-only for now (write support coming in v1.0)

**Try the Beta:**

Homebrew (easiest):
```bash
brew tap deverman/focus-relay
brew install focus-relay-mcp
```

The installed binary is `focusrelay`. Run the MCP server with:

```bash
focusrelay serve
```

Or download from GitHub: https://github.com/deverman/FocusRelayMCP/releases

**Important:** First time you run a query, OmniFocus will ask you to approve the automation script. Click "Run Script" (this is normal for security).

**What's Next:**

This is a beta (v0.9.0) - read support is solid, write support (adding tasks) is coming in v1.0. I'd love your feedback on what queries you'd find most useful!
